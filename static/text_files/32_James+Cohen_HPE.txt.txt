The advantages of a Blockchain
Œ
Speed and efficiency
Œ
Significantly lower transaction costs
Œ
Transparency and self
-
auditing
Œ
Opportunities for automation (i.e. smart contracts)
Œ
The democratization of the exchange of value
Œ
The potential to create a trusted universal platform to connect companies, 
people, nations, machines, and more

Blockchain is immutable
Blockchain is a Distributed Ledger, but not all Distributed Ledgers 
are Blockchain
Blockchain enables trust between parties who do not necessarily 
have existing trust 
Œ
trustless exchange
Blockchain is not just about cryptocurrency 
Œ
it is about delivery of 
transactions as code 
Œ
Smart Contracts
Authentication using encryption using private/public keys

Speeding and Simplification 
Cross Border Payments
Œ
In 2015 cross
-
border payments amounted to more than $150 trillion and 
generated fees in excess of $200 billion
Œ
Current process is expensive and slow (typically about 10 days between the USA 
and Europe)
Œ
There are multiple banks involved, but the system is well established and reliable 
(SWIFT is used by more than 10,000 institutes in 200 countries)
Œ
The alternatives such as Western Union are very expense 
Œ
at about 10%
Œ
Typical costs of remittances are between 5% and 20%
Œ
Blockchain will reduce this to between 2% and 3% and reduce the time to less than 
one hour
Œ
Will require the wide spread use of Digital Currencies, where 1 digital unit will be 
worth 1 fiat unit
Œ
Proper regulation will be needed between the regulators as to how Blockchain will 
be deployed

Cutting out the middleman
The future of Share Trading
Œ
Blockchain could replace a complete exchange, without the need 
for a central system to bring supply and demand together
Œ
The physical exchange has already been replaced by the data 
center and servers
Œ
Nasdaq has already started a Blockchain initiative to lower 
transactions costs and speed settlement, replacing the share 
registration companies
Œ
Scalability remains an issue that needs resolution
Œ
Dedicated Blockchain 
trading networks such as the one being built 
by Nasdaq, are created from the ground up with high volume 
trading in mind, but are still very much in the testing 
phase
